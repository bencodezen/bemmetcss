## Why We Built This

Ever get tired of sitting there trying to come up with the perfect naming schema for your new module? Or how about wanting to just quickly prototype things without the hassle of trying to come up with the appropriate place it goes in your architecture?

Bemmet is a system designed to be a prototype-first system which then grows into the appropriate CSS architecture desired. It provides some basic guidelines for prototyping, but we know the flaw with being overly opinionated; so the key thing with this is flexibility.

More guidelines to come as we finalize our thoughts and ideas for how to grow your own organic and home-grown CSS architecture.
